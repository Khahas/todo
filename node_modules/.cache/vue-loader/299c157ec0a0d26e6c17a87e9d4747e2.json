Richard McClintock, \n a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, \nlooked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, \nfrom a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word \nin classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. \nLorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \n\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,\n written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, \n very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \n \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is \nreproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and \n1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also \nreproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English \nversions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n    </span>\n    \n  </div>\n\n",null]}
